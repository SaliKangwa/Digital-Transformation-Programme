<h2>Description</h2>
This project focused on enhancing document management, process digitization, and data analytics within the Engineering and Commercial departments. It involved setting up On-Prem SharePoint Sites to improve document accessibility and streamline workflows. Additionally, manual processes were digitized through the development of in-house solutions, integrating structured data collection and automation. To support data-driven decision-making, multiple Power BI reports were created, including the Engineering Maintenance Planning Report, Service Contract Reports, and Kansanshi Finance Review Report, providing real-time insights for maintenance planning, contract management, and financial reviews.
